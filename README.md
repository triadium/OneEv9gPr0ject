# One Ev9g Pr0ject
Once I decided to switch to developing of games... and to make a prototype prototype in one evening ...
This is one single player fighting game (must be).

# Zenject is the best!
This project uses Zenject framework to be easy for tests and modulirity.
And it is way to EcsRx.

Media resources for the project are located in a separate repository:
